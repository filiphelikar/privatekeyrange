![Bitcoin Private Key Range Calculator](https://www.filiphelikar.cz/img/key_range.png "Bitcoin Private Key Range Calculator")

This project is a calculator for computing the range of private keys for a Bitcoin puzzle and calculating the speed of a brute-force attack. The application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Svelte. This project demonstrates my skills in cryptography and creating user-friendly interfaces.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to input parameters related to Bitcoin private keys and view calculations related to potential key ranges and brute-force attack speeds. It serves as a practical demonstration of cryptographic concepts and efficient UI/UX design.

## Features

- Compute ranges of Bitcoin private keys.
- Calculate brute-force attack speeds.
- User-friendly interface designed with Svelte.
- Real-time calculation updates based on user input.

## Getting Started

This project was generated using [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte), providing all the necessary tools to develop and build a Svelte application.

### Creating a Project

To create a new Svelte project, use the following command:

```bash
# Create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# Create a new project in a specific directory
npm create svelte@latest my-app
